# Optimus-Switch-for-Arch-Linux
Automatic nvidia driver installer for Arch Linux with optimus-switch-qt

It sets up Pamac AUR helper for optimus-manager-qt

To properly install everything, make sure that you've removed your existing prime/bumblebee setup or your xorg server would most likley to crash.
I don't take any responsibility for anything (Nvidia drivers are really rough -_-) so do everything at your own.

Go to the directory and inside, type:
sudo chmod +x start.sh

it will make start file executable.

When everything is setted up open optimus manager setting at the little icon and import optimus-manager-qt.conf file whitch is included inside your zip file

Make sure to check "start this program at the startup" at the settings.

reboot

enjoy :)
